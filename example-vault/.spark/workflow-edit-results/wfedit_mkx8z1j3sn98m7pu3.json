  "responseMessage": "This workflow generates and refines creative statements through an iterative evaluation process. Here's how it works:\n\n**Flow Overview:**\n\n1. **Propose topics** (node_1): Generates 3-5 diverse topics spanning different themes (technology, nature, human experience, etc.) as inspiration.\n\n2. **Generate statement** (node_2): Creates a compelling 1-2 sentence statement based on the proposed topics.\n\n3. **Evaluate creativity** (node_3): Scores the statement on a 1-10 scale for creativity and engagement, providing reasoning for the score.\n\n4. **Score approved?** (node_4): A decision point that checks if the score is 8 or higher:\n   - **If YES (score ≥ 8)**: The statement is approved and sent to the final output\n   - **If NO (score < 8)**: The statement needs improvement and enters a refinement loop\n\n5. **Enhancement Loop** (when score < 8):\n   - **Enhance creativity** (node_5): Rewrites the statement to be more creative, engaging, and memorable using vivid language and unexpected connections\n   - **Prepare for re-evaluation** (node_6): Formats the enhanced statement\n   - Loops back to **Evaluate creativity** (node_3) for another scoring round\n\n6. **Extract final statement** (node_7): Returns the approved statement with its score and reasoning.\n\n**Key Feature:** The workflow can cycle up to 5 times (maxCycles setting) to iteratively improve the statement until it achieves a score of 8 or higher. In your recent run, it took 2 cycles - the first statement scored 7/10, was enhanced, and then scored 9/10 to pass approval."
