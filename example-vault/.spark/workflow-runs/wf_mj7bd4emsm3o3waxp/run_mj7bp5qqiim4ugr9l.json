Companies deploying autonomous systems at scale have learned that robust error handling and human-in-the-loop safeguards are non-negotiable, as agents can cascade failures across interconnected systems in ways traditional software rarely does. Monitoring and observability become exponentially more complex when systems make decisions dynamically rather than following predetermined code paths. The most successful deployments treat agents as collaborative tools rather than full replacements, establishing clear boundaries for autonomous action and escalation protocols for edge cases. Perhaps the hardest lesson is that agent reliability isn't just about model accuracy—it's about building resilient architectures that gracefully handle the inherent unpredictability of AI-driven decision-making."
