Unlike traditional workflow tools that require explicit programming of every decision branch, these systems leverage large language models to understand context, make intelligent choices, and adapt to unexpected situations in real-time. By combining the reliability of structured workflows with the flexibility of AI reasoning, agentic editors enable teams to build automation that handles edge cases and evolves alongside changing business requirements."
