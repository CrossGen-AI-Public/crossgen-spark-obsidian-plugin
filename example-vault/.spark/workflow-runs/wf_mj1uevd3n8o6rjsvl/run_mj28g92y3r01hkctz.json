These systems combine the flexibility of visual workflow builders with the intelligence of large language models, enabling agents to understand user intent and automatically construct appropriate task sequences. By bridging the gap between no-code automation platforms and autonomous AI capabilities, agentic workflow editors empower both technical and non-technical users to orchestrate sophisticated operations through natural language instructions."
