Unlike traditional workflow tools that require manual configuration and rigid rule-setting, these editors leverage large language models to interpret context, make intelligent decisions, and adapt processes dynamically. This approach dramatically reduces the technical expertise needed to create sophisticated automations while enabling more flexible, context-aware systems that can handle exceptions and edge cases with human-like reasoning."
