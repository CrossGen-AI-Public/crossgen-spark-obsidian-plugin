These systems can dynamically adapt workflows based on context, learn from outcomes, and make autonomous decisions about task routing and resource allocation while maintaining human oversight at critical junctures. By combining natural language understanding with process automation, agentic workflow editors lower the barrier to entry for complex automation tasks, enabling users to describe desired outcomes conversationally rather than through rigid configuration interfaces."
