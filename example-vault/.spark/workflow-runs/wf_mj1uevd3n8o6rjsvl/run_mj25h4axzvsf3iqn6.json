        "content": "Agentic workflow editors empower users to design and automate complex multi-step processes by orchestrating AI agents that can reason, make decisions, and execute tasks autonomously. These tools shift the paradigm from rigid, rule-based automation to adaptive workflows where agents can handle exceptions, learn from context, and collaborate with humans or other agents to achieve goals. By abstracting technical complexity behind intuitive interfaces, agentic workflow editors democratize advanced automation, enabling non-technical users to build sophisticated systems that previously required extensive programming expertise."
