Unlike traditional workflow tools that require explicit programming of every decision path, these editors leverage large language models to interpret intent, adapt to changing conditions, and make contextual decisions during execution. This approach dramatically reduces the technical barrier to automation while enabling more flexible, intelligent workflows that can handle ambiguity and evolve based on real-world feedback."
