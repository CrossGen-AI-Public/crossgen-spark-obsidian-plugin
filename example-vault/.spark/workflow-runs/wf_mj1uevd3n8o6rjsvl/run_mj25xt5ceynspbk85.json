Unlike traditional workflow tools that require explicit configuration of every step, agentic editors leverage large language models to interpret natural language instructions and dynamically adapt workflows based on context and outcomes. This approach enables non-technical users to create sophisticated automations while allowing the system to handle edge cases, make intelligent decisions, and even suggest workflow improvements autonomously."
