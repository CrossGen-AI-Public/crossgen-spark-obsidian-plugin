        "content": "Agentic workflow editors represent a new paradigm in automation tools, where AI agents can autonomously execute complex multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention. These systems combine natural language understanding with programmatic actions, allowing users to define workflows conversationally while the agent handles file operations, API calls, and decision-making logic. By shifting from traditional visual flow builders to intelligent, context-aware editors, agentic workflows reduce the gap between intent and execution, making sophisticated automation accessible to non-technical users."
