Unlike traditional workflow tools that require explicit rule definitions, these editors leverage large language models to understand context, make decisions, and adapt workflows dynamically based on real-time conditions and outcomes. They enable non-technical users to orchestrate sophisticated automation pipelines through natural language instructions, while providing developers with powerful abstractions for building self-improving systems that learn from execution patterns."
