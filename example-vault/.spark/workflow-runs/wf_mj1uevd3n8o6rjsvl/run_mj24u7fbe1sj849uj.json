        "content": "Agentic workflow editors represent a new paradigm in automation tools, where AI agents can autonomously execute complex, multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention. Unlike traditional workflow builders that require rigid predefined rules, these systems leverage large language models to make contextual decisions, adapt to unexpected situations, and even modify workflows on the fly. This enables non-technical users to create sophisticated automations through natural language, while developers gain powerful tools for orchestrating AI agents that can reason, plan, and collaborate to accomplish business objectives."
