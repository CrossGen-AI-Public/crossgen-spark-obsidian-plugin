These systems leverage large language models to understand context, make intelligent decisions at each workflow step, and dynamically adapt processes based on real-time feedback and outcomes. By combining the structured reliability of traditional workflow automation with the flexibility and reasoning capabilities of AI agents, they enable more sophisticated task orchestration that can handle ambiguous requirements and evolving business needs."
