Unlike traditional static workflow tools, these systems allow agents to reason about task dependencies, adapt to changing conditions, and even redesign processes on the fly to achieve better results. This capability transforms workflows from rigid scripts into intelligent, self-improving systems that can handle complex, multi-step operations with minimal human intervention."
