These systems combine natural language understanding with programmatic control, allowing users to define workflows conversationally while the AI handles the underlying logic, error handling, and dynamic decision-making. By enabling agents to autonomously navigate tasks, query information, and adapt to changing conditions, agentic workflow editors dramatically reduce the cognitive load on users and transform workflow design from rigid scripting into flexible, goal-oriented collaboration."
