        "content": "Agentic workflow editors represent a new paradigm in automation tools, where AI agents can autonomously plan, execute, and adapt multi-step processes based on natural language instructions. Unlike traditional workflow builders that require manual configuration of each step, these systems leverage large language models to interpret intent, make decisions, and dynamically adjust execution paths in response to errors or changing conditions. This approach dramatically reduces the technical barrier to automation, enabling users to describe desired outcomes rather than prescribe exact procedural steps."
