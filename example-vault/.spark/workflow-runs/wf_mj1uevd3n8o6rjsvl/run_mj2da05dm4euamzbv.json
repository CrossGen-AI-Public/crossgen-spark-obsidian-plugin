Unlike traditional workflow systems that follow rigid, predefined paths, agentic editors leverage large language models to interpret instructions, handle exceptions, and dynamically adjust execution based on intermediate results. This approach enables more flexible, human-like task management where workflows can reason about their goals, collaborate across different tools and systems, and even self-optimize based on outcomes."
