These intelligent systems can analyze workflow performance, identify bottlenecks, and autonomously adjust task sequences, conditional logic, and resource allocation to improve efficiency and adapt to changing requirements. By combining the structure of traditional workflow engines with the reasoning capabilities of large language models, agentic workflow editors enable more resilient and self-improving automation systems that can handle complex, unpredictable scenarios without constant human intervention."
