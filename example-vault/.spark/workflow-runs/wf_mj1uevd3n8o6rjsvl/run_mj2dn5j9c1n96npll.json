Unlike traditional workflow tools that require manual configuration, these systems learn from execution history and can propose or implement improvements autonomously, adapting to changing requirements without human intervention. By combining the structure of traditional workflow engines with the intelligence of AI agents, they enable more resilient and self-improving automation systems that can handle edge cases and evolve alongside business needs."
