      "content": "Your workflow is failing because of a syntax error in the condition node's expression.\n\n**The Problem:**\nIn the condition node (action_mkxa0729rgtx7gnt9), the expression is:\n```\ninput.'test2' == 2\n```\n\nThis syntax is invalid JavaScript. You cannot use quotes around property names when accessing them with dot notation.\n\n**Additional Issues:**\n1. The input object has a property called `test1` (not `test2`), so even with correct syntax, this condition would always be false\n2. The edge from the condition node has `sourceHandle: \"false\"` but is labeled as \"true\" in the className, which is inconsistent\n\n**How to Fix:**\nYou have two options for the correct syntax:\n\nOption 1 - Bracket notation:\n```\ninput['test2'] == 2\n```\n\nOption 2 - Dot notation (no quotes):\n```\ninput.test2 == 2\n```\n\n**Or**, if you meant to check `test1` instead:\n```\ninput.test1 == 1\n```\n\nWould you like me to fix the condition expression for you? Just let me know which property you want to check and what value it should equal.",
